Step 3:
        Follow the the instructions in bert_server_instruction.py
Step 4:
        Run classifier_bert.py, it will take long to get bert vector from server. Or run cassifier_bert_with_saved_vector.py after download my trained vector from https://drive.google.com/open?id=17KJ97zjKNsGuAKM9x2L622ruwdSX5tt3
